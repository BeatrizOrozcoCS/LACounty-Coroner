# LACounty-Coroner (Incomplete)
Data visualization project using LACounty-Coroner data from thier public websites
<br />
### Still filling out the Readme and Respository.
# Why make this project
This project was inspired by LA Times Homicide Report. https://homicide.latimes.com/ <br />
It made me realize that many people die in an area and it is not mentioned in the news and I wanted to bring awareness to myself of all the lives lost. 

The end goal of this project is to show people how I managed to webscrape data from a difficult webpage that uses JQuery to populate thier fields and 
to show what I was able to find and how I am progressing in my project. 

# Things to Note
This project is only data from people processed by the LA County Medical Examiner Office so it is simply a portion of all the deaths that happend in LA County. 

### LACounty-Coroner Website:
There are three websites to get data from. <br />
